                        <p class="description">Challenge Project 1 from the University of Minnesota Fullstack Coding Bootcamp</p>
                        <p class="description">This project focuses on refactoring the provided code and adjusting it to create a more accessible site. By making the site more accessible not only does this make the site easier to use, but it also helps improve search engine optimization.</p>
                        <p class="description">Through this project I've learned about many key aspects of Web Development. I learned the importance of semantic HTML elements and the difference compared to non-semantic elements. I also learned how HTML features such as logical page structure, element attributes, and even styling can all play an important role in making a site more accessable. I also learned the role that accessability has in terms of improving SEO and how by making a site more accessible it "helps search engine algorithms understand the content better and improve searchability".</p>

                                The focus of this project is to use Javascript to make the webpage interactive.
                                Through this project I've learned more about Javascript and functions and objects in Javascript.</p>

                            <p class="description">This project was a group effort that allowed me to really focus on JavaScript and learn while practicing using Server Side API's. 
                                The most significant thing I've learned from this project apart from having the opportunity to learn more about API's, was being able to work in a group 
                                and get a feel for how projects can look in a work environment. I also got to learn a lot more about using GitHub for group projects.
                                My contributions to this project can be seen in the countries about section, where I used the RESTCountries API to get, display, and store data to the site.

                                Through this project I learned about Web API's and Client-Side Storage, as well as 
                                more about events. I learned about the Document Object Model and interactivity. 
                                Through these topics I've also learned about events and how to handle those events 
                                using methods such as addEventListener.</p>
