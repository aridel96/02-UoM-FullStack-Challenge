# 02-UoM-FullStack-Challenge

## Description
Challenge Project 2 from the University of Minnesota FullStack Coding Bootcamp.

This project focuses on building a portfolio web page that showcases a potential employee's skills and the web applications they have worked on. 

Through this project I had the opportunity to learn more and develop my skills on specific aspects on CSS and Web Development such as flexbox and media queries. Flexbox and media queries focus on making the site more responsive and allows the web page to adjust how the elements of the page take up space and are displayed and veiwed by the user depending on the device they are using.
